## Grace
I’mma drop this weird frankensteined creature looking unicorn here. Work has been stressful and I hope I can quickly move on with my career to an even better work situation.

## Minji
Maybe it’s the quality of the lines (and the subject) that’re inspiring me, but I just did whatever I could to make this look like a kid did this. Bling bling dark fairy unicorn transformation complete!!!
