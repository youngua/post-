## Grace
Once upon a time the fire nation attacked...and then there the airbender with the four elements was nowhere to be found. Then then, I stumbled upon an ice-ball in my freezer and cracked it in my ice-coffee. Then out of nowhere formed the last avatar. The Mystique creature with it’s all four elements conquered the fire nation and made everything perfect. I liked my ice-coffee cold after all. 


## Minji
I embodied the spirit of the mystique creature? avatar? whatever the creature is? with my coloring. After reading the description for the lienart, I’m honestly more confused than ever.

Grace, is your brain okay?

(ALSO! Thank you for renaming the files btw. I keep forgetting to change it when I export directly to google drive)
