I don’t know what I just drew, maybe they are cute monsters behind ghost cloak and mask. It is something whimsical I guess. Was also thinking about the little forest spirit from Princess Mononoke while drawing these fellows so I guess that was my main source of inspiration.

In 2021, I will chill out and take things slow...

Just kidding, you know me. Here’s to trying, though!
