## Minji
Conversation in my head:
“Oh wow, another photo of a person dreaming? How original”
“Yes”
To my defense, they’re sleeping on a GALAXY, under a BLANKET with a door on it. Blame the generic tech illustrations I’ve been looking at on Adobe Stock.

## Grace
lately I have been watching my friend go through an illustration glow up and her illustrations are soo soothing to look at. She specialized in color and is from manila. Follow her on instagram, give her likes and promote her work because she is about to be famous ✨✨✨ Follow her instagram here @madeleine.teh 

I took inspiration from her work and did my own take of coloring. I think the gradients are coming back for me. Brb, checking when I started or stopped using gradients.
