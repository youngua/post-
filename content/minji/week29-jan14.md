My dreams have been so weird lately. Maybe I’ve already told you once or twice already, but the content has just been so cursed. I’m not a very spiritual or superstitious person, but it’s gotten to a point where I don’t even feel comfortable detailing them in my dream journal like usual  just so I don’t manifest them somehow. I wouldn’t call them nightmares; they’re just so deeply uncomfortable and technically possible in real life I don’t want to jinx it by lingering on my thoughts.

I’m still getting great sleep, but my dreams have become something I can’t really control. Like two weeks ago when I went crabbing with Mavis and John and we got trapped in super thick fog in the middle of a fjord at Point Reyes when the sun was going down. I wasn’t panicking in the moment, but in retrospect it was genuinely the most terrifying thing that’s happened to me. For a solid 2 hours as we tried to paddle our way back to the shore we came from, we kept circling on the water without going anywhere because we couldn’t see anything. When we finally reached land again, we realized that we’d migrated .5 miles from where we started.

Anyway, that was the inspiration for this week: two things that are/were terrifying in an unsettling way in one picture.

Lately, I have been overwhelmed by work and my side projects. I want to do them all to the best of my ability and I want all to be of a good quality but alas, I feel I have too many to attend to. I’m going to have to timebox my time and perhaps sleep less and work more to get most of the work done. Man life is hard after college, but I hope it will get better at least as I work my ass off.
